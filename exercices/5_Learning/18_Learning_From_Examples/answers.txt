1) Consider the problem faced by an infant learning to speak and understand a language. Explain how this process fits into the general learning model. Describe the percepts and actions of the infant, and the types of learning the infant must do. Describe the subfunctions the infant is trying to learn in terms of inputs and outputs, and available example data.

2)Repeat Exercise 18.1 for the case of learning to play tennis (or some other sport with which you are familiar). Is this supervised learning or reinforcement learning?
